        It's an amazing, almost inspiring thing, what happens when Zendaya gets in front of a camera.
      </p>

      <h2>The Perfect Future</h2>

      <p>
        Before visiting the set of her British Vogue cover shoot in late January, I imagined her regarding the whole ordeal with gracious indifference. 
        (The model in my mind was Ingrid Bergman at the 1975 Academy Awards, dryly telling the audience after her third career win that it was "always 
        very nice to get an Oscar.") Zendaya has, after all, been working in Hollywood since she was 13; she's served as an ambassador for Louis Vuitton, 
        Valentino, Tommy Hilfiger, Bulgari, and Lancéme; and, at 27, she's already won the Emmy for best lead actress in a drama twice. Surely, posing for 
        a magazine would be, dare I say it, kind of boring to her by now?
       (Actually, two magazines: This month, she becomes one of the rare stars to cover British Vogue and Vogue US simultaneously.)
      </p>

      <p>
        "When I was younger there was less pressure," she says. But now, while she's in town for the couture—and can't exit a building without trending on X—Zendaya has little choice but to become that girl again. "I got to get into a zone of being that part of myself, which is definitely not a thousand percent natural," she allows. "She gets rusty."
      </p>

    <aside class="pull-quote">
      <blockquote>
        Make things and pop out when I need to pop out, and have a protected life with my family, not worried if I'm not delivering something
      </blockquote>
    </aside>

    <section class="article-section">
      <p>
        To her 184 million-odd admirers—if Instagram is anything to go by—one of Zendaya's greatest gifts is to seem both improbably perfect (so tall, so poised, so plugged into all the right things, from racial justice to voting rights) and somehow familiar, like the girl everyone got along with in high school.
      </p>

      <p>
        "I still have to sometimes try to not fangirl when I'm around her," says the 20-year-old actor Storm Reid, who plays her younger sister on Euphoria. The two first met over a decade ago, at a Ben & Jerry's in Los Angeles, where Reid—then about nine—timidly asked for a picture. Within a few years they'd be singing Beyoncé songs together in Zendaya's trailer. "She's still one of my biggest inspirations, and I think she's just so incredibly talented."
      </p>

      <p>
        Zendaya has channeled that alluring, unknowable, It-girl-next-door thing into a knack for playing good people with secrets: a teenage spy in K.C. Undercover; the charming but manipulative addict Rue in Euphoria; the acerbic introvert Michelle, a.k.a. MJ, in Spider-Man: Homecoming.

          (When she first auditioned for the latter part, in about 2016, "to be honest with you, neither Kevin Feige nor I knew who she was," says Amy Pascal, who has, with Feige, produced all of Zendaya's Spider-Man films. "She was wearing no makeup and she was just dressed like a regular girl, and we were like, 'Oh my God, she's amazing. She has to be in the movie.' And then we found out she was a totally famous person, and felt really stupid.")

        She's also been a sylphlike acrobat—introduced with the words "Who's that?"—in The Greatest Showman, and, as Chani in Dune, a shimmering desert mirage turned love interest-slash-mentor-slash-skeptic of Timothée Chalamet's messianic Paul Atreides.

        The perfect future: "make things and pop out when I need to pop out, and have a protected life with my family, not worried if I'm not delivering something."
